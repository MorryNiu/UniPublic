### K-means

- Soft k-means clustering
  - Using softmax to calculate the distance
  - Small $\beta$, soft
  - Large $\beta$, hard
- Use EM(expectation maximisations) to solve the k-mean problem



### Evaluating the Cluster Out

- Unsupervised
  - How separate is one cluster from other clusters
    - We like it to be high
  - How cohesive is the instances inside a cluster
    - We like it to he high
- Supervised
  - How well do cluster labels match externally supplied class labels
-
