# Week 1 - Information Session

## Cloud Characteristics (Lecture notes and then my paraphrasing)

- On-demand self-service
  - A consumer can provision computing capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with each service provider. 
  - Scale computing resources up and down by needs without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
- Networked access
  - Capabilities are available over the network and access through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous client platforms.
  - Resources and be access through network and adapted to heterogeneous client platforms.
- Resource pooling
  - The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model potentially with different physical and virtual resources that can be dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
  - Providerâ€™s resources are pooled and can be dynamically assigned and reassigned by need.
- Rapid Elasticity
  - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly upon  demand.
  - Capabilities can scale easily and rapidly upon demand.
- Measured Service
  - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.
  - Resourcing optimization by measuring usage

## Flavour

- Compute clouds
  - Amazon Elastic compute cloud
  - Azure
- Data Clouds
  - Amazon Simple Storage Service
  - Google docs
  - iCloud
  - Dropbox
- Application Clouds
  - App store
  - Virtual image factories
- Public/Private/Hybrid/Mobile/Health Clouds

## History

### Distributed System

- <u>**Transparency**</u> and **<u>heterogeneity</u>** in computer-computer interactions
- Finding resources -> Binding resources -> run time type checking -> invoking resources
- Dealing with heterogeneous of system
- Challenges
  - Complexity of implementations
  - Vendor specific solutions
  - Scalability problem
  - Sharing data between different organizations

### Grid Computing

- From computer-computer focus to organisation-organisation focus
- Can be thought of as a distributed system with non-interactive workloads.
- It is in contrast to the traditional notion of a supercomputer, which has many processors connected by a local high-speed computer bus instead of Ethernet.
- Challenge
  - What resources are available
  - To determine the status of resources
  - Job scheduling
  - Virtual organization support
  - Security
    - Public key infrasturctures
